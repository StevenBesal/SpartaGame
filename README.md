# Chicken RUN!

 https://stevenbesal.github.io/SpartaGame/
 
Hi welcome to Chicken run, the bases of this game is to help the chicken escape the farm and cross the road. Using the directional keys, navigate the page and reach the otherside of the road avoiding the moving car, which if hit will cost and life and place your nect chicken a the start position.

Please remember to have fun, and hit the mute button if the sound effects really drive you up the coop. You have 3 lives save as many as you can.

### Installation

* Simply download the file from github and assess the HTML file with your preferred browser. 
* This is a html file, which will work with most standard browser.
* The best way to play the game would be on a desktop using a window of 1400px x 800px, (the game isn't optismied for smaller screens such as smart phones in the current vision due to keyboard functionality).

#### Challanged faced 
The main challanged faced involved getting the cars to move around a grid and have them repeat, as well as checking for a collision with the chicken as it tempts to cross the road.

#### MVP
The MVP of the project was to get a working game that calculates a score and has a leaderboard or a defined win condition.
 
#### Feature which need fixing
* As of this current vision the highscore doesn't retain a high score once the player has lost all lives and sady reverts to the default.
<br>
* The game doesn't have a definitive gameOver screen once all lives are lose but instead instantly restarts the game with 0 score. In the future this will be added to complete the story of the chickens and their journy. 
features to be added

#### Future Feature
* In the future the game will have a defined game over screen and dependent on the score display a different message.
* Levels will be added or the game will become more difficult as the score increase to add an extra challenge to the game, and add more of a social aspect as friends compete.
* As the game is an omarge to frogger, the next logical idea would be to add a water lane to travers, where the play more alone with the stream.
